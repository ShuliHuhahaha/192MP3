The Western movie plays an important role in film history. *Zorro* is probably the most well-known Western character worldwide: Its cultural icons, nomadic gunfighter, bandits, soldiers and settlers had an important impact on the movie culture. Yet the most recent *Zorro* film (2005) was produced more than a decade ago. The hibernation of the Zorro series in some way reflects the current stagnant status of the Western genre. The Western genre, being the very genre that had [played a big role in the birth of Hollywood](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/10/magazine/11schatz.html) [^1]  seems to have faded from sight over time. 

Since its golden peak with the rise of Hollywood film industry in 1912 for short films and in 1925 for long films, western movie production has taken a dramatic downfall and gradually decreased over the past century. However, the genre seemed to have come back into fashion around 2014 for both long and short films, with the release of new movies like *The Lone Ranger* and *A Million Ways to Die in the West*, starring celebrity actors such as Johnny Depp and Charlize Theron respectively. Is revival strong enough to dispel the repeated claim by the critics (e.g. Agresta, 2013)  that Western is a dying genre? Probably not. In this article, we examined the history Western movie production with respect to their broadcasting media and masterminds behind.[^2]

Over the course of 1900 - 2015, there are 13693 western movies in total, and 9951 (73%) of them were tagged with at least one another genre. In the linear graph,  pure Western (red line) movies represent those long movies categorized only as Western genre rather than being in multiple genres. The early Western movies are mainly Short films, whose production costs are relatively low compared to long movies on cinema. However, the majority of Western movies during the prosperous years 1920s -- 1960s are actually long movies. Surprisingly, short films rallied back in the 2010s, whereas the production of long western movies has only slightly risen.

Further, the contents of Western movies have definitely evolved dramatically. For both short (in 1912) and long films (1925),  Western movies had already associated with several other genres . Let’s take Zorro for example: The first movie adaption of Zorro is “the Mark of Zorro,” labeled as western, adventure and romance. This movie had won great attention in the 1920s. Beside Zorro’s mysterious identity and benevolent actions, the romantic relationship between Zorro and his lover Lotita is an important parallel storyline in the movie. 

Compared with western movies in 1912, Western movies in 2014 were even more diversely defined in genres. While the traditional “complementary” genres, such as adventure and romance, remain their popularity in the 21st century, some new cross-genres such as fantasy, horror and musical are coming to stage. This could explain why western movies periodically came back in fashion and increased in production amount, as directors could find ways to incorporate western elements into other genres or vice versa. 


```{r}
# Extra information on the genre population in 1925 & 2014
movie.genre.1925.2014 <- movie.genre %>%
  filter(info != "Short") %>%
  filter(production_year == 1925 | production_year == 2014) %>%
  group_by(production_year, Genre = info) %>%
  summarise(number_movie = n_distinct(movie_id)) %>%
  spread(production_year, number_movie)

datatable(movie.genre.1925.2014,
          colnames = c('Genre', '1925', '2014'),
          rownames = FALSE,
           options = list(columnDefs = list(list(
            className = 'dt-center', targets = 0
          ))),
          caption = htmltools::tags$caption(
    style = 'text-align: center; font-size:150% ;',
    'Long Movie Genre Production in 1925 and 2014')
          )
```

If we pulled out individual genre to examine, however, Western is ranked the fifth to the last among all long movie genres produced in 2014, while it was ranked the fourth in 1925 (**Note** for the table: click on the arrow buttons next to the year headers to play with the ranking). As long movie has become the mainstream form of entertainment since 1920s, the drastic comparison of Western production volume clearly signifies Western film’s decreasing popularity. Perhaps other genres have distracted the audience from the Western.

How do media productions other than theater movie response to the western genre? While movie is always the major type of media production fond of the western genre, some other types of media production, such as TV movies and video movies, are coming into fashion. This trend suggests that perhaps "Western" as a genre is only fading from the the cinema. However, as the on-demand TV program and personal computer becoming more and more universal, an increasing number of movies will be watched on TV and personal computer instead of in cinema. The western TV movies, which emerge in the 1960s, do not show the same trend as the western movies in cinema. The quantity of TV movies production remains pretty stable (8 movies per year) during 1970s to 2000s, where the Western movies in cinema are downhill. As for the video movies, which emerges from the 1990s, shows the potential to share the broadcast channel of Western movies in the future. 

[Critics](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2014/06/16/daily-circuit-western-movies)[^3] claimed that as long as a Western movie is on the screen, people would watch it. However, the mediocre grossing of the recent long Western movies, such as [*The Lone Ranger*](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2014/06/16/daily-circuit-western-movies), may further discourage the big studios to produce long films in this genre. To some extent, this argument may also justify the revival of the Western short film in 2014: as the production of short films is generally cheaper than that of long films, artists probably would rather experiment with the Western genre in short films. Yet since short film is not the mainstream form of entertainment,  the short western films have not gained much attention in recent years.

Wrapping up, even though the western genre has a slight revival in movie production recently, it is specific to the short film production. our data analysis does not give an optimistic prediction for the future of this genre. The popularity of western still remains stagnant in long movie production, which is the mainstream entertaining form today. As an artistic genre so core to American values, Western will not completely disappear in the films, but it may not be able to return to the main stage of movie production for a while.
